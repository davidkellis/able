# Able v10 Spec TODOs

- [x] Integrate pattern + break semantics from `design/pattern-break-alignment.md` into the canonical specification (capture optional break label/value, literal/array/typed pattern behaviour, and shared error messages).
- [x] Document struct pattern destructuring rules once Go evaluator gains struct literal/member support and fixtures are in place.
- [x] Add v10 prose covering the shared executor contract (`proc_yield`, `proc_flush`, cancellation guarantees) now that Go and TypeScript runtimes align.

See `spec/TODO_v11.md` for backlog items targeted at the next spec cycle.
