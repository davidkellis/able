# Able v10 Spec TODOs

- [x] Integrate pattern + break semantics from `design/pattern-break-alignment.md` into the canonical specification (capture optional break label/value, literal/array/typed pattern behaviour, and shared error messages).
- [x] Document struct pattern destructuring rules once Go evaluator gains struct literal/member support and fixtures are in place.

- [ ] Document functional update semantics for structs in examples after generics support lands.
