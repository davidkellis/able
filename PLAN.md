# Able Project Roadmap (v12 focus)

## Standard onboarding prompt
Read AGENTS, PLAN, and the v12 spec, then start on the highest priority PLAN work. Proceed with next steps. We need to correct any bugs if bugs or broken tests are outstanding. We want to work toward completing the items in the PLAN file. Please mark off and remove completed items from the PLAN file once they are complete. Remember to keep files under one thousand lines and to refactor them if they are going to exceed one thousand lines. You have permission to run tests. Tests should run quickly; no test should take more than one minute to complete.

## Standard next steps prompt
Proceed with next steps as suggested; don't talk about doing it - do it. We need to correct any bugs if bugs or broken tests are outstanding. We want to work toward completing the items in the PLAN file. Please mark off and remove completed items from the PLAN file once they are complete. Remember to keep files under one thousand lines and to refactor them if they are going to exceed one thousand lines. Tests should run quickly; no test should take more than one minute to complete.

## Scope
- Keep the frozen Able v10/v11 toolchains available for historical reference while driving all new language, spec, and runtime work in v12.
- Use the Go tree-walking interpreter as the behavioral reference and keep the Go bytecode interpreter in strict semantic parity.
- Preserve a single AST contract for every runtime so tree-sitter output can target both the historical branches and the actively developed v12 runtime; document any deltas immediately in the v12 spec.
- Capture process/roadmap decisions in docs so follow-on agents can resume quickly, and keep every source file under 1000 lines by refactoring proactively.

## Existing Assets
- `spec/full_spec_v10.md` + `spec/full_spec_v11.md`: authoritative semantics for archived toolchains. Keep them untouched unless a maintainer requests errata.
- `spec/full_spec_v12.md`: active specification for all current work; every behavioral change must be described here.
- `v10/` + `v11/`: frozen workspaces (read-only unless hotfix required).
- `v12/`: active development surface for Able v12 (`interpreters/go/`, `parser/`, `fixtures/`, `stdlib/`, `design/`, `docs/`).

## Ongoing Workstreams
- **Spec maintenance**: stage and land all wording in `spec/full_spec_v12.md`; log discrepancies in `spec/TODO_v12.md`.
- **Go runtimes**: maintain tree-walker + bytecode interpreter parity; keep diagnostics and fixtures aligned.
- **Tooling**: build a Go-based fixture exporter; update harnesses to remove TS dependencies.
- **Performance**: expand bytecode VM coverage; add perf harnesses for tree-walker vs bytecode.
- **WASM**: run the Go runtime in WASM with JS tree-sitter parsing and a defined host ABI.
- **Stdlib**: keep v12 stdlib aligned with runtime capabilities and spec requirements.

## Tracking & Reporting
- Update this plan as milestones progress; log design and architectural decisions in `v12/design/`.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` synced with onboarding steps for new contributors.
- Historical notes + completed milestones live in `LOG.md`.
- Keep this `PLAN.md` file up to date with current progress and immediate next actions, but move completed items to `LOG.md`.

## Guardrails (must stay true)
- `./run_all_tests.sh` (v12 default) must stay green for the Go suites and fixtures.
- `./run_stdlib_tests.sh` must stay green (tree-walker + bytecode).
- Diagnostics parity is mandatory: tree-walker and bytecode interpreters must emit identical runtime + typechecker output for every fixture when `ABLE_TYPECHECK_FIXTURES` is `warn|strict`.
- After regenerating tree-sitter assets under `v12/parser/tree-sitter-able`, force Go to relink the parser by deleting `v12/interpreters/go/.gocache` or running `cd v12/interpreters/go && GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache go test -a ./pkg/parser`.
- It is expected that some new fixtures will fail due to interpreter bugs/deficiencies. Implement fixtures strictly in accordance with the v12 spec semantics. Do not weaken or sidestep the behavior under test to "make tests pass".

## TODO (working queue: tackle in order, move completed items to LOG.md)
- Compiler AOT vision and correctness plan (see `v12/design/compiler-aot.md`).
- Compiler AOT: define explicit dynamic boundary semantics in `spec/full_spec_v12.md`.
- Compiler AOT: add compiler gap tracking entries in `spec/TODO_v12.md`.
- Compiler AOT: build full module dependency graph and preserve typechecker outputs.
- Compiler AOT: dynamic feature detection per module and function with tests.
- Compiler AOT: define typed IR with explicit evaluation order and error flow.
- Compiler AOT: lower AST to typed IR with match, patterns, and control flow semantics.
- Compiler AOT: implement compiled runtime core types (Array, BigInt, Ratio, String, Channel, Mutex, Future).
- Compiler AOT: emit Go packages per Able package with direct static calls.
- Compiler AOT: compile stdlib and kernel packages as Go code and wire into builds.
- Compiler AOT: implement interface dispatch dictionaries and overload resolution in compiled code.
- Compiler AOT: implement dynamic boundary bridge for compiled ↔ interpreter values and calls.
- Compiler AOT: compiled main executes compiled code directly and only invokes interpreter for dynamic features.
- Compiler AOT: fixture parity tests for compiled output over all exec fixtures.
- Compiler AOT: stdlib test suite runs in compiled mode with parity checks.
- Compiler AOT: diagnostics parity between compiled output and interpreters.
- Compiler AOT: concurrency semantics parity in compiled mode, including scheduler helpers.
- Compiler AOT: enforce no silent fallback in compiled output.
- Compiler AOT: performance baseline after correctness parity is green.
- Compiler AOT: ensure everything in v12/design/compiler-aot.md is implemented.
- WASM: prototype JS tree-sitter parsing that feeds AST into the Go/WASM runtime.
- WASM: build a minimal `ablewasm` runner (Node + browser harness) once the Go runtime builds to WASM.
- WASM: document the WASM deployment contract in `v12/docs/`.
- Regex syntax: add regex AST nodes and grammar in tree-sitter (quantifiers, groups, classes, alternation).
- Regex syntax: wire AST mapping for regex nodes in Go parser.
- Regex syntax: add fixtures/tests for regex AST output and exec behavior; keep stdlib engine parity.
- Regex syntax: add parser corpus cases that cover nested groups, alternation, and escaped quantifiers.
- Regex syntax: update `spec/TODO_v12.md` with remaining regex syntax/semantics gaps.
- Regex syntax: align stdlib regex implementation with parser outputs as grammar coverage expands.
