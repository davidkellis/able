# Able Project Log

## 2025-11-11 — Pipe Fixture Parity
- Added the exported AST fixture `pipes/multi_stage_chain`, which chains `%` topic arithmetic, placeholder-built callables, struct wrapping, topic method calls, and implicit bound methods to exercise multi-stage pipeline semantics end to end.
- Updated `fixtures/ast/typecheck-baseline.json` and regenerated fixture artifacts via `bun run interpreter10/scripts/export-fixtures.ts` so both interpreters ingest the new scenario from the shared corpus.
- Verified the TypeScript harness with `ABLE_FIXTURE_FILTER=pipes/multi_stage_chain ABLE_TYPECHECK_FIXTURES=strict bun run scripts/run-fixtures.ts` (spot-check) plus the full run (`bun run scripts/run-fixtures.ts`), and kept the Go suite green with `GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache go test ./pkg/interpreter`; no TS/Go divergences surfaced.

## 2025-11-11 — Typechecker Strict Fixtures
- TypeScript’s typechecker now treats struct identifiers as value expressions (so `Channel.new` resolves without undefined identifier diagnostics) and predeclares `:=` bindings before evaluating the RHS, allowing proc handles to reference themselves during construction.
- Iterator literals seed their custom driver binding (in addition to the implicit `gen` helper), struct patterns bind field patterns/bindings with resolved field types, and array patterns now propagate element bindings so for-loop destructuring exposes its locals to guards/bodies.
- Package member diagnostics no longer leak private symbol names—aliases and wildcard imports consistently report “has no symbol.” The wildcard-private fixture manifest/baseline now records its expected typechecker diagnostic.
- With these fixes in place, `ABLE_TYPECHECK_FIXTURES=strict bun run scripts/run-fixtures.ts` completes successfully, keeping the shared fixture corpus green under strict mode.

## 2025-11-09 — Executor Diagnostics Helper
- Added the `proc_pending_tasks()` runtime helper so Able programs/tests can observe cooperative executor queue depth. TypeScript wires it through `CooperativeExecutor.pendingTasks()` while the Go runtime surfaces counts from both the serial and goroutine executors (best-effort on the latter via atomic counters). The helper is registered with both typecheckers so Warn/Strict fixture runs understand the signature.
- New coverage keeps the helper honest: Bun unit tests exercise the helper directly (`interpreter10/test/concurrency/proc_spawn_scheduling.test.ts`), Go gains matching tests (`TestProcPendingTasksSerialExecutor`, `TestProcPendingTasksGoroutineExecutor`), and a serial-only AST fixture (`fixtures/ast/concurrency/proc_executor_diagnostics/`) ensures both interpreters prove that `proc_flush` drains the cooperative queue.
- Spec + docs now describe the helper alongside `proc_yield`/`proc_flush` (see `spec/full_spec_v10.md`, `docs/manual/*.md/html`, `design/concurrency-executor-contract.md`, and `AGENTS.md`), and the PLAN TODO for “Concurrency ergonomics” is officially closed out.

## 2025-11-08 — Fixture Diagnostics Parity Enforcement
- `interpreter10/scripts/run-parity.ts` now diffs typechecker diagnostics for every AST fixture so warn/strict parity runs catch unexpected checker output even when manifests do not declare expectations. The parity JSON report captures the mismatched diagnostics to speed up triage.
- Added `test/scripts/parity/fixtures_compare.test.ts` to cover the helper logic that determines when diagnostics mismatches should fail parity.
- Go’s typechecker now treats unannotated `self` parameters inside `methods {}` / `impl` blocks as `Self`/concrete receiver types and seeds iterator literals with the implicit `gen` binding, eliminating the extra diagnostics that used to appear only in Go’s warn/strict runs.
- Added Go regression tests (`pkg/typechecker/checker_impls_test.go`, `pkg/typechecker/checker_iterators_test.go`) so implicit `self` bindings and iterator generator helpers stay covered.
- Bun’s typechecker mirrors the same behaviour: iterator literals now predefine the implicit `gen` binding, implicit `self` parameters default to `Self`, and new tests (`test/typechecker/method_sets.test.ts`, `test/typechecker/iterators.test.ts`) keep the coverage locked in.
- The Go fixture runner and CLI now continue evaluating programs in warn/strict modes even when diagnostics are reported (matching the Bun harness), so parity checks capture both the expected runtime results and the shared diagnostics payloads.

## 2025-11-07 — AST → Parser → Typechecker Cycle Revalidated
- Added proc handle memoization fixtures (success + cancellation) and ensured both interpreters plus the Go parser harness run them under strict typechecking (`bun run scripts/run-fixtures.ts`, `cd interpreter10-go && GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache GO_PARSER_FIXTURES=1 go test ./pkg/parser`).
- Verified the full suite remains green (`./run_all_tests.sh --typecheck-fixtures=strict`, `bun test`, `cd interpreter10-go && GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache go test ./pkg/interpreter`), keeping the Priority 0 gate satisfied.
- Updated PLAN.md to mark the current AST → Parser → Typechecker cycle complete and advance the focus to Phase α (Channel & Mutex runtime bring-up).
- Added stdlib specs for channel/mutex behaviour (`stdlib/v10/tests/concurrency/channel_mutex.test.able`) so the Phase α bullet “add unit tests covering core operations” is now satisfied.

## 2025-11-07 — Serial Executor Future Reentrancy
- Go’s SerialExecutor now exposes a `Drive` helper that runs pending proc/future tasks inline, so nested `future.value()` / `proc_handle.value()` calls no longer deadlock and match the TypeScript scheduler semantics. The helper steals the targeted handle from the deterministic queue, executes it re-entrantly (including repeated slices when `proc_yield` fires), and restores the outer task context once the awaited handle resolves.
- Fixtures `concurrency/future_value_reentrancy` and `concurrency/proc_flush_fairness` now pass under the Go interpreter’s serial executor, keeping the newly added fairness/re-entrancy corpus green for both runtimes (`ABLE_TYPECHECK_FIXTURES=strict bun run scripts/run-fixtures.ts`, `cd interpreter10-go && GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache go test ./pkg/interpreter`).
- PLAN immediate actions trimmed: the “Concurrency stress coverage & docs” placeholder has been cleared now that the blocking fixtures run cleanly; follow-up concurrency work can graduate to design docs instead of the top-level plan.
- Added a Go-side regression test (`TestSerialExecutorFutureValueReentrancy`) that mirrors the new fixture to ensure nested `future.value()` calls stay green even if future contributors touch the executor; the design note `design/go-concurrency-scheduler.md` now documents the inline-driving behaviour and follow-up doc work.
- Added a companion fixture (`concurrency/proc_value_reentrancy`) plus TypeScript exporter wiring + Go regression test (`TestSerialExecutorProcValueReentrancy`) so both interpreters exercise nested `proc.value()` waits under the serial executor; parser coverage tables were updated accordingly.
- Documented the goroutine-executor fairness contract (what `proc_yield`/`proc_flush` mean under `GoroutineExecutor`, how we rely on Go’s scheduler, and when tests must fall back to the serial executor) to close out the remaining PLAN follow-up (`design/go-concurrency-scheduler.md`).
- Updated the v10 spec to codify re-entrant `proc.value()` / `future.value()` semantics so both interpreters (and future targets) must guarantee deadlock-free nested waits (§12.2.5 “Re-entrant waits”).
- Added direct Go unit tests (`TestProcHandleValueMemoizesResult`, `TestProcHandleValueCancellationMemoized`) to ensure repeated `value()` calls return memoized results/errors even after cancellation, satisfying the remaining “exercise repeated value() paths” item from the concurrency plan.
- Introduced the `concurrency/proc_value_memoization` fixture (plus exporter wiring) so both interpreters prove proc handles memoize values, and updated the Go parity harness to run it with the goroutine executor.
- Added `concurrency/proc_value_cancel_memoization` to assert that cancelled proc handles return the same error for repeated `value()` calls without re-running their bodies; the fixture exporter, AST corpus, and fixture run all cover this scenario now.

## 2025-11-06 — Tree-Sitter Mapper Modularization Complete
- Go declarations/patterns/imports all run through the shared `parseContext`, removing the last raw-source helpers so both runtimes share one parser contract (`interpreter10-go/pkg/parser/{declarations,patterns,statements,expressions}_parser*.go`).
- TypeScript parser README now calls out the shared context, and `PLAN.md` logged the Step 6 regression sweep so future contributors know the refactor is locked in (`interpreter10/src/parser/README.md`, `PLAN.md`).
- Wrapper exports like `parseExpression(node, source)` / `parseBlock` / `parsePattern` were removed; all Go parser consumers now flow through the context pipeline.
- Tests: `./run_all_tests.sh --typecheck-fixtures=warn` and `cd interpreter10-go && GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache GO_PARSER_FIXTURES=1 go test ./pkg/parser`.
- Follow-up: confirm any remaining helpers that still accept raw source (e.g., host-target parsing) genuinely require it before migrating them to `parseContext`.

## 2025-11-03 — AST → Parser → Typechecker Completion Sweep
Status: ✅ Completed. Parser coverage table reads fully `Done`, TypeScript + Go checkers share the bool/comparison semantics, and `ABLE_TYPECHECK_FIXTURES=strict bun run scripts/run-fixtures.ts` executes cleanly after wiring the remaining builtin signatures, iterator annotations, and error fixture diagnostics into the manifests.

Open items (2025-11-02 audit):
- [x] Iterator literals dropped both the optional binding identifier and optional element type annotation. Update both ASTs + parsers/interpreters so the metadata survives round-trips and execution.
- [x] Teach both typecheckers to honor the iterator element annotation so every `yield` matches the declared element type (TS `src/typechecker/checker.ts`, Go `pkg/typechecker/literals.go` + iterator tests).
- [x] Carry iterator element metadata through `for` loops so typed loop patterns validate across array/range/iterator inputs (TS `src/typechecker/checker.ts`, Go `pkg/typechecker/{control_flow,literals,type_utils}.go` + new cross-loop tests).
- [x] Give the TS checker parity with Go for block/proc/spawn typing and array/range literal inference so all three stages (AST → parser → typechecker) agree on the element/result metadata (§6.8, §6.10, §12.2).
- [x] Enforce async-only builtins (`proc_yield`) and add concurrency smoke tests so TS emits the same diagnostics as Go when authors call scheduler helpers outside `proc`/`spawn`.
- [x] Implement `if`/`while` diagnostics + inference in the TS checker so control-flow expressions match the Go implementation (§8.1/§8.2).
- [x] Mirror Go's match/rescue guard enforcement in the TS checker (§8.1.2 / §11.3).
- [x] Enforce package privacy + import diagnostics in the TS checker so private packages/definitions behave identically to Go (updated `imports.test.ts` + package summaries carry `visibility` metadata).

## Historical Status Notes

### 2025-10-30
- Comments are now ignored during parser → AST mapping for both interpreters.
  - ✅ Go: `ModuleParser` / helper utilities skip `comment`, `line_comment`, `block_comment` nodes and `TestParseModuleIgnoresComments` asserts the behaviour.
  - ✅ TypeScript: `tree-sitter-mapper` filters the same node types; `fixtures_mapper.test.ts` covers the mapping path and `fixtures_parser.test.ts` ensures the raw grammar parses comment-heavy sources.
- TODO: audit remaining parser/mapping gaps per `design/parser-ast-coverage.md` (pipes/topic combos, functional updates, etc.) and backfill fixtures/tests.
- DONE: comment skipping now wired through struct literals, struct patterns, and related mapper helpers across both runtimes.
- TODO: Build end-to-end coverage across **all three facets** (parsing, tree → AST mapping, AST evaluation) for both interpreters. Use the coverage table to drive fixture additions, parser assertions, and runtime tests until every spec feature is green.
- TODO: Extend the **typechecker** suites (Go + TS) so they verify type rules and inference across modules. Assemble an exhaustive inference corpus exercising expression typing, generics, interfaces/impls, and cross-module reconciliation; ensure these scenarios are evaluated alongside runtime fixtures.

### 2025-10-31
- Regenerated the tree-sitter-able artifacts with the freshly rebuilt grammar (interface-composition fix now baked into `parser.c`/`.wasm`) using the local Emscripten toolchain; no diff surfaced, confirming the repo already carried the correct bits.
- Cleared local Go build caches (`.gocache`, `interpreter10-go/.gocache`) and re-ran `GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache GO_PARSER_FIXTURES=1 go test ./pkg/parser` to mimic CI picking up the refreshed grammar without stale entries.
- ACTION: propagate the cache-trim guidance to CI docs if flakes recur; otherwise move on to the remaining parser fixture gaps (`design/parser-ast-coverage.md`).
- Mirrored the TypeScript placeholder auto-lift guardrails inside the Go interpreter so pipe placeholders evaluate eagerly, keeping the shared `pipes/topic_placeholder` fixture green.
- Parser sweep: both the TypeScript mapper and Go parser now skip inline comments when traversing struct literals, call/type argument lists, and struct definitions, with fresh TS/Go tests guarding the behaviour.
- TypeScript checker scaffold landed: basic environment/type utilities exist under `interpreter10/src/typechecker`, exported via the public index, and fixtures respect `ABLE_TYPECHECK_FIXTURES` ahead of the full checker port.
- TypeScript checker now emits initial diagnostics for logical operands, range bounds, struct pattern validation, and generic interface constraints so the existing error fixtures pass under `ABLE_TYPECHECK_FIXTURES=warn`.

### 2025-11-01
- TypeScript checker grew a declaration-collection sweep that registers interfaces, structs, methods, and impl blocks before expression analysis, mirroring the Go checker’s phase ordering.
- Implementation validation now checks that every `impl` supplies the interface’s required methods, that method generics/parameters/returns mirror the interface signature, and flags stray definitions; only successful impls count toward constraint satisfaction.
- Canonicalised type formatting to the v10 spec (`Array i32`, `Result string`) and keyed implementation lookups by the fully-instantiated type so generic targets participate in constraint checks.
- Extended the TypeScript checker’s type info to capture `nullable`, `result`, `union`, and function signatures, and taught constraint resolution to recognise specialised impls like `Show` for `Result string`, with fresh tests covering the new cases.
- Added focused Bun tests under `test/typechecker/` plus the `ABLE_TYPECHECK_FIXTURES` harness run to lock in the new behaviour and guard future regressions.
- Mirrored the Go checker and test suite to use the same spec-facing type formatter and wrapper-aware constraint logic so diagnostics now reference `Array i32`, `string?`, etc., and added parity tests (`interpreter10-go/pkg/typechecker/*`).

### 2025-11-02
- The Bun CLI suite (`interpreter10/test/cli/run_module_cli.test.ts`) now covers multi-file packages, custom loader search paths via the new `ABLE_MODULE_PATHS` env, and strict vs warn typecheck enforcement so the ModuleLoader refactor stays covered without pulling `stdlib/` into every run.
- Introduced the `able test` skeleton inside `scripts/run-module.ts`: it parses the planned flags/filters, materialises run options + reporter selection, and prints a deterministic plan summary before exiting with code `2` while the stdlib testing packages remain unparsable. (See `design/testing-cli-design.md` / `design/testing-cli-protocol.md`.)
- Extracted the shared package-scanning helpers (`discoverRoot`, `indexSourceFiles`, etc.) into `scripts/module-utils.ts` so other tooling (fixtures runner, future harnesses) can reuse the multi-module discovery logic without duplicating it.
- **Deferral noted:** full stdlib/testing integration is still on pause until the parser accepts `stdlib/v10/src/testing/*`; once that unblocks, wire the CLI skeleton into the able.testing harness per the design notes.

### 2025-11-05
- Step 6 regression sweep ran end-to-end: `./run_all_tests.sh --typecheck-fixtures=warn` stayed green post-refactor, and `GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache GO_PARSER_FIXTURES=1 go test ./pkg/parser` uncovered/validated the Go-side AST gaps.
- Go AST parity improvements: `FunctionCall.arguments` now serialises as an empty array when no args exist, `NilLiteral` carries `value: null`, and break/continue statements omit label/value when not supplied (matching the TS mapper contract).
- Parser helper normalisation no longer nukes empty slices before fixture comparison, and parameter lists default to `[]`, which brought the channel/mutex fixtures back in sync.
- Fixture `structs/functional_update` gained explicit `\"isShorthand\": false` flags so both interpreters agree on struct literal metadata going forward.

### 2025-11-06
- Go CLI now exposes `able check` alongside `able run`, sharing the manifest/target resolution pipeline. Both commands surface ProgramChecker diagnostics + package summaries and fail fast when typechecking reports issues, keeping the TypeScript + Go CLIs aligned.
- Added dedicated CLI tests to cover `able check` success/failure cases so future refactors keep the new mode wired through manifest resolution, typechecker reporting, and exit codes.

### 2025-11-07 — Phase α (Channel/Mutex) Completion
- Audited channel/mutex stdlib wiring across both runtimes: helper registration, typechecker signatures, fixtures, and prelude exports now match; no AST or scheduler drift detected.
- Added Bun smoke tests for nil-channel cancellation and mutex re-entry errors (`interpreter10/test/concurrency/channel_mutex.test.ts`) to mirror the Go parity suite.
- Documented the audit and captured the remaining TODO (map native errors to `ChannelClosed`/`ChannelNil`/`ChannelSendOnClosed`) in `design/channels-mutexes.md` and `spec/TODO.md`.
- Cleared `Phase α` from the active roadmap; next milestone is Phase 4 (cross-interpreter parity/tooling).

### 2025-11-07 — Fixture Parity Harness (Phase 4 Kick-off)
- Added a Go CLI entry point (`cmd/fixture`) that evaluates a single AST fixture and emits normalized JSON (result kind/value, stdout, diagnostics) with respect to `ABLE_TYPECHECK_FIXTURES`. The helper reuses the interpreter infrastructure and supports serial/goroutine executors while sandboxing the Go build cache.
- Refactored the TypeScript fixture loader into `scripts/fixture-utils.ts` so both the CLI harness and Bun tests can hydrate modules, install runtime stubs, and intercept `print` output consistently.
- Rebuilt `run-fixtures.ts` on top of the shared utilities (no behavior change) to keep fixture execution logic single-sourced.
- Introduced a Bun parity test (`test/parity/fixtures_parity.test.ts`) that exercises a representative slice of the shared fixture corpus (currently 20 fixtures across basics + concurrency) against both interpreters and asserts matching results/stdout via the new Go CLI.

### 2025-11-08 — Parity CLI Reporting
- Added `interpreter10/scripts/run-parity.ts`, reusable parity helpers, and Bun parity suites that now share the same execution/diffing logic across AST fixtures and curated examples.
- `run_all_tests.sh` now invokes the parity CLI so local + CI runs execute the same cross-interpreter verification and drop a JSON report at `tmp/parity-report.json` for machine-readable diff tracking; `tmp/` landed in `.gitignore` to keep artifacts out of commits.
- The helper script also honors `ABLE_PARITY_REPORT_DEST` or `CI_ARTIFACTS_DIR` so pipelines can copy the parity JSON into their artifact buckets without bespoke wrapper scripts.
- Updated `interpreter10/README.md` and `interpreter10-go/README.md` with parity CLI instructions, env knobs (`ABLE_PARITY_MAX_FIXTURES`, `ABLE_PARITY_REPORT_DEST`), and guidance on keeping the cross-interpreter harness green.
- Added Go package docs (`pkg/interpreter/doc.go`, `pkg/typechecker/doc.go`) plus README guidance on regenerating `go doc`/pkg.go.dev pages so the documentation workstream is unblocked.
- Landed `dynimport_parity` and `dynimport_multiroot` in `interpreter10/testdata/examples/` to cover dynamic package aliasing, selector imports, and multi-root dynimport scenarios end-to-end; the parity README + plan now list them alongside the other curated programs, and the Go CLI + Bun harness honor `ABLE_MODULE_PATHS` when resolving shared deps.
- Authored `docs/parity-reporting.md` and linked it from the workspace README so CI pipelines know how to persist `tmp/parity-report.json` via `ABLE_PARITY_REPORT_DEST`/`CI_ARTIFACTS_DIR`.
- The Go CLI (`cmd/able`) now honors `ABLE_MODULE_PATHS` in addition to `ABLE_PATH`, with new tests ensuring the search-path env works; stdlib docs reference the alias so multi-root dynimport scenarios can rely on a single env knob across interpreters.
- Fixed the `..`/`...` range mapping bug in both parsers so inclusive ranges now follow the spec (TS + Go parser updates, new parser unit tests, interpreter for-loop regression tests, and fizzbuzz-style parity coverage).

### Phase 5 Foundations — Parser Alignment
- Canonical AST mapping now mirrors the fixture corpus across both runtimes. The TypeScript mapper’s fixture parity suite (`bun test test/parser/fixtures_mapper.test.ts`) and the Go parser harness (`go test ./pkg/parser`) stay green, so every tree-sitter node shape maps to the shared AST contract with span/origin metadata.
- `tree-sitter-able` grammar coverage is complete for the v10 surface (see `design/parser-ast-coverage.md`); new syntax is added directly with fixture+cXPath tests so the grammar remains authoritative.
- Translators and loaders are live in both interpreters: TypeScript’s `ModuleLoader` and Go’s `driver.Loader` now ingest `.able` source via tree-sitter, hydrate canonical AST modules, and feed them to their respective typechecker/interpreter pipelines.
- End-to-end parse → typecheck → interpret tests exercise both runtimes: `ModuleLoader pipeline with typechecker` (Bun) covers the TS path, and `pkg/interpreter/program_pipeline_test.go` drives the Go loader/interpreter via `GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache go test ./pkg/interpreter`.
- Diagnostic coverage now rides on the same pipelines: the new Bun test asserts missing import selectors surface typechecker errors before evaluation, and the Go suite verifies that `EvaluateProgram` halts (or proceeds when `AllowDiagnostics` is set) when return-type violations are reported.
