package exec_11_03_rescue_ensure

## Semantics: `rescue` handles the raised error and mutates captured state before `ensure`, which still runs after the rescue executes.

fn main() -> void {
  result := ""
  do {
    raise "boom"
  } rescue {
    case err => { result = `rescued: ${err.message()}` }
  } ensure {
    print(result)
    print("ensured")
  }
}
