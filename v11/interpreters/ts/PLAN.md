## Able v11 Interpreter Plan

This interpreter-specific plan has been consolidated into the root-level `PLAN.md`, which now tracks every outstanding and completed workstream (runtime, parser, typechecker, stdlib, and Go parity). Consult the root plan for priorities, progress, and next actions; add future interpreter milestones there so we maintain a single authoritative roadmap.
