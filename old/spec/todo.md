Okay, reviewing the specification we've built together, here's a breakdown of what's well-defined, what needs refinement, and what major components are still missing:

**Well-Defined / Mostly Defined Areas:**

1.  **Core Philosophy:** Hybrid, minimal, static/strong, GC.
2.  **Lexical Structure:** Basic tokens, comments (`##`), identifiers, literals (including interpolated strings), whitespace significance (mostly insignificant), primitive type names (`i32`, `string`, `nil`, `void`, etc.).
3.  **Types (Fundamentals):** Concept of types as named sets, type expressions (space-delimited generics, parens for grouping), concrete vs. polymorphic types, constraints (`:`).
4.  **Primitive Types:** Integer/float types, `bool`, `char`, `string`, `nil` (type and value), `void`.
5.  **Structs:** Singleton, named-field, positional-field definitions; instantiation; field access; functional update (`...`); mutation.
6.  **Unions:** Definition (`union ... = V1 | V2`), nullable shorthand (`?Type`), construction, basic usage via `match`.
7.  **Assignment/Destructuring:** `Pattern = Expression` syntax, various patterns (identifier, `_`, struct, array, nested). Default mutability for bindings.
8.  **Functions:** Named definition (`fn`), anonymous `fn`, lambda syntax (`{ params => expr }`), closures, invocation (standard, trailing lambda, UFCS, `Apply`), partial application (`_`).
9.  **Interfaces/Implementations:** Definition (`interface ... for SelfTypePattern`), `Self` keyword, implementation (`impl ... for Target`), HKT style (`for M _`, `impl ... A for Constructor`), composite interfaces (`= I1 + I2`), named implementations (`Name = impl`), static methods (`Type.method`), specificity rules. Only function members allowed in interfaces.
10. **Control Flow:** Branching (`if/or`, `match case`), Looping (`while`, `for .. in`), Range expressions (`..`, `...`), Non-local jumps (`breakpoint`/`break`).
11. **Packages:** Config (`package.yml`), naming convention, imports (various forms), privacy (`private`).
12. **String Interpolation:** `` `... ${expr} ...` `` syntax.
13. **Block Expressions:** `do { ... }` syntax for general-purpose scoped blocks evaluating to the last expression.

**Needs Refinement / Clarification:**

1.  **Operator Details:** Precedence and associativity rules for all operators (`+`, `*`, `..`, `|>` etc.). Possibility of custom operators?
2.  **Defaults:** Default types for integer (`i32`?) and float (`f64`?) literals need confirmation.
3.  **Mutability:** Confirm the "mutable by default" binding strategy or introduce `let`/`var`. Define mutability for `Array T`.
4.  **Standard Library Interfaces:** Precisely define the signatures and semantics for assumed interfaces like `Iterable`, `Numeric`, `Display`, `Hash`, `Range`. Define the `Iterator` protocol/pattern used by `for` loops.
5.  **Error Handling Strategy:** How should recoverable vs. unrecoverable errors be handled? Is `Result T E` (defined via `union`) the primary mechanism? How do panics work? What's the role of `breakpoint`/`break` in error flow?
6.  **Type System Details:**
    *   Detailed type inference rules.
    *   Precise definition of "compatible types" for `if/or` and `match` branches.
    *   Mechanism for "interface types" / dynamic dispatch (e.g., `Array (Display)` syntax and semantics).
    *   Variance rules (co/contra/invariance) for generic types.
    *   Coercion rules (if any).
7.  **Invocation/Method Resolution Details:**
    *   Confirm interaction of named implementations with UFCS/method call syntax (e.g., `value.ImplName.method(...)`).
    *   Clarify resolution of UFCS access like `i32.double` vs instance access `5.double`.
    *   Arity limit for the `Apply` interface methods.
8.  **Module System:** Import resolution details (paths, cycles?).
9.  **Lexical Details:** Block comment syntax (`/* ... */`?). Full list of keywords. Exact numeric literal syntaxes (prefixes `0x`, suffixes `u8` etc.).

**Major Missing Sections:**

1.  **Standard Library Implementation:** This is the biggest gap. We need definitions for:
    *   **Core Data Structures:** `Array` (methods like `length`, `get`, `set`, iteration), potentially `Map`/`HashMap`, `Set`. `ArrayBuilder`.
    *   **IO:** Console (`print`, `readln`?), File System, Networking.
    *   **String Manipulation:** Standard methods (`length`, `split`, `join`, `contains`, `to_uppercase`, etc.).
    *   **Core Utilities:** `Option`, `Result` types (if not user-defined via union), assertion/panic functions.
    *   **Numeric Operations:** Standard math functions.
2.  **Concurrency / Parallelism:** No model defined yet (e.g., `async`/`await`, actors, threads, channels).
3.  **Foreign Function Interface (FFI):** How to interact with code from other languages (e.g., C).
4.  **Metaprogramming:** Macros, compile-time evaluation? (Optional feature).
5.  **Entry Point:** How does an Able program start execution? (e.g., a required `main` function).
6.  **Tooling:** Definition of the standard build tools, package manager commands, testing framework, debugger support.

In summary, the core syntax and semantics for types, functions, control flow, and interfaces are reasonably well-defined, but the standard library, concurrency, error handling strategy, FFI, and tooling are major areas yet to be specified. There are also several points needing refinement within the existing sections.
